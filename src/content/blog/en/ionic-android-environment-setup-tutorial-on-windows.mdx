This post is in response to a request made by a developer in addition to my talk
[Hybrid apps with Ionic. You can start developing now!](https://tiagoporto.com/en/blog/hybrid-apps-with-ionic-you-can-start-developing-now-talk/).

So let's get straight to the point.

1.  Ionic and Apache Cordova is required, so if you haven't installed them yet, let's go.

    - Both are Node packages and we need to install them.
      Download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download.
    - **Do not uncheck <abbr title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr>**.

      ![Nodejs setup screen](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/node-setup-screen.png)

      _Does not know what Node and <abbr title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr> are.
      Read: [Node.js vs NPM: Understanding the Differences](https://hostadvice.com/blog/web-hosting/node-js/node-js-vs-npm/)._

2.  With Node installed, now let's move on, open the terminal and install Ionic and Cordova.

    - Execute the command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g cordova ionic
    ```

    ![Terminal with Ionic installation and Ionic Getting Started page in the background](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/ionic-install.png)

3.  Let's begin setting up the Android environment.
    Let's install the Java <abbr title="Java Development Kit">JDK</abbr>.

    - Go to [Java Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html),
      select <abbr title="Java Development Kit">JDK</abbr> download, and choose the
      version compatible with your <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> (32 or 64 bits).
      _Check the installation path; it will be necessary for the next step._
    - Now we'll create the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in Windows,
      open the System Panel with the <kbd>windows</kbd> + <kbd>pause/break</kbd>
      keys or go to `Control Panel / System and Security / System`.
    - Click on `Advanced system settings`.
    - Select `Environment Variables`.
    - Select `New`.
    - In the new window, enter `JAVA_HOME` in the variable name, and the path where
      you installed the <abbr title="Java Development Kit">JDK</abbr> in the value.
      For instance, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65`.
    - Save.

      ![Windows with the path to edit environment variables in Windows](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/adding-system-var.png)

    - Select the `Path` variable, and click on edit,
      in the variable values field, add `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the end of the string.
      Don't forget the `;`.
    - Save.

4.  With Java configured, we will need Apache Ant, he one responsible for the build.
    Download it at [Ant Download](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi).

    - Once the download is complete, extract the directory to the `C:`.
    - Once again we need to update the `Path` variable to add Ant.
      Open the Windows environment variables.
    - Select `Environment variables`.
    - Select the `Path` variable and click edit.
    - Add the path to the Ant bin folder, for example `;C:\apache-ant-1.9.6\bin`.
      And don't forget the `;`.
    - Save

5.  The next step is the installation of the Android <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr>,
    the API which provides the libraries and tools needed to build, test and
    debug Android.

    - Download it from the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other),
      select the **.exe (Recommended)**.
    - Once installed, we need to create the `ANDROID_HOME` variable,
      required by Cordova. Open the environment variables.
    - Select `Environment variables`.
    - Click New.
    - In the new window, in the variable name, enter `ANDROID_HOME`, in the
      variable value, enter the path to the `android-sdk` folder you just installed,
      for instance: `C:\Android\android-sdk`.
    - Save.

      ![Windows new system variable panel](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/android-home-var.png)

    - Going back to the environment variables, select the `Path` variable and
      click edit.
    - Add `;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` to variable value.
    - Save.
    - We're almost there, now we need to install the Android packages.
      Open the `SDK Manager.exe` file, located inside the `android-sdk` folder.
    - By default **Tools/Android SDK Tools** Tools is already installed.
      If for some reason it isn't, select it.
    - Check **Tools/Android SDK Platform-tool**, **Tools/SDK build-tools**
      (one version above 22)
    - Under **API** select the same version you selected in **Build Tools**.
    - Under Extras, check **Google USB Driver**, which is required to
      debug directly in the device.
    - Click install.

    - Once the installations are finished, our environment is ready.

6.  Now, let's add the Android platform to the app.

    - Open the application directory via the terminal.
    - Run:

      ```bash
      ionic platform add android
      ```

      ![Terminal installing the Android platform in the Ionic project](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/ionic-platform-add-android.png)

7.  It's time to try the `.apk` build.

    - Run

      ```bash
      ionic build android
      ```

    - Once the process is complete, the generated `.apk` path is displayed in the terminal.

      ![Terminal building Android](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/ionic-build-android.png)

8.  You can also debug the app direct on the device. Connect the device
    via <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> cable, make sure you
    have enabled **USB debugging** on the device.

    - Run

      ```bash
      ionic run android
      ```

Thatâ€™s it, happy coding!
