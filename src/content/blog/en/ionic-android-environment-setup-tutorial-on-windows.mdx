This post will respond to a request made by a developer related to my talk
https://speakerdeck.com/tiagoporto/aplicativos-hibridos-com-ionic-voce-tambem-pode-comecar-a-desenvolver-agora
(Hybrid applications with Ionic. You can also start developing now!). He was unsure of how to set up the environment
to develop for Android.

So let’s get right down to business.

1.  Of course we need the Ionic and Apache Cordova, if you have not installed them, let’s do it.

    - Both are Node packages and so we need the Node installed. Download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
    - In the installation NPM is required, do not remove it.

    > If you don’t know what is Node and NPM, visit http://nodebr.com/o-que-e-a-npm-do-nodejs/

1.  With the Node installed, now we open the terminal and install the Ionic and Cordova.

    - Runs

    ```bash
    npm install -g cordova ionic
    ```

    ![Ionic install and ionic getting started page on background](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/ionic-install.png)

1.  We begin setting up the environment for Android. We will install the Java JDK.

    - Access the link http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html, select JDK download,
      download the version compatible with your OS (32 or 64 bits). _See the path where you installed,
      it will be needed at the next step_.
    - Now let’s create the **JAVA_HOME** variable in the Windows environment.
      Open the System screen using the “windows + pause / break” or go to
      “Control Panel / System and Security / System”.
    - Click “Advanced System Settings”.
    - Select Environment Variables.
    - Select New environment variable.
    - In the new window, in the name of the variable place **JAVA_HOME**, and in
      the value put the path where you installed the JDK. For example,
      **C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65**. Click OK.
      ![Windows Edit System Var Path](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/adding-system-var.png)
    - Select the **path** variable, and click edit. Again, a window will open
      with the variable data. In the variable field values, go to the end of the
      string and add **;%JAVA_HOME%\bin**. Do not forget the `;`.
      ![Adding new system var](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/adding-bin-system-var.png)

1.  With Java configured, now we need the Apache Ant, responsible for making the
    build of our application. Download at the link http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi.

    - After finished downloading, extract the directory to the root of `C:`.
    - Again we need to update the path variable to add the Ant. Open the environment variables from Windows again.
    - Abra as variáveis de ambiente do windows novamente.
    - Select Environment Variables.
    - Select the **path** variable and click edit.
    - Add the path to the bin directory of the Ant, for example,
      `;C:\apache-ant-1.9.6\bin`. Again, do not forget the `;`.
      ![System var edit modal](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/adding-ant-system-var.png)

1.  The next step is to install the Android SDK, the API that provides libraries
    and tools required to build, test and debug Android.

    - Download in http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other, select the
      **.exe** (Recommended).
    - Once installed, we need to create the variable `ANDROID_HOME`, necessary for
      Cordova. Again, open the environment variables from Windows.
    - Select Environment Variables.
    - Click New.
    - In the new window, in the name of the variable place `ANDROID_HOME`, and in the
      variable value put the path to the `android-sdk` folder you just installed,
      for example: `C:\Android\android-sdk`. Click OK.
      ![System var edit modal](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/android-home-var.png)
    - Return to environment variables, select the variable `path`, and click edit.
      In the new window in the variable value field, go to the end of the string
      and add `;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools`.
    - We’re almost there, now we need to install the android packages. Open
      `SDK Manager.exe` file, located inside the `android-sdk` folder.
    - By default the `Tools/Android SDK Tools` is already installed. If for some
      reason it is not marked as installed, select it. Also, select
      `Tools/Android SDK Platform-tool`, `Tools/SDK build-tools` (a version above 22),
      and select the same **API** version that you selected in the `Build Tools`.
      Also mark `Extras/Google USB Driver` (required to debug directly on the device),
      and click install.
      ![Android SDK Manager Panel](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/android-sdk-manager-panel.png)
    - At the end of the installations our environment is set up.

1.  Let’s do the test. Returning to our application, open the application directory for the terminal and add the android platform.

    - Run

    ```bash
    ionic platform add android
    ```

    ![Ionic add Android platform](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/ionic-platform-add-android.png)

1.  Let’s build our `.apk`.

    - Run

    ```bash
    ionic build android
    ```

    ![Ionic build Android](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/ionic-build-android.png)

    - After finishing the process, the path of the generated `.apk` is displayed in the terminal.

1.  We can also debug the application directly on the device. Plug the device
    via USB cable, make sure you have enabled the USB debugging, and run
    ```bash
    ionic run android
    ```
    ![Run Android](/blog/ionic-android-enviroment-tutorial/run-android.jpg)

That’s it, Good luck and good development.
