## Tree Shaking

Given the speed at which JavaScript is moving forward, having annual versions
bringing new features, we ended up having to add a compiler
([Babeljs](https://babeljs.io/), one of the most popular today) to our stack in
order to take advantage of all these new features and ensure compatibility with
older browsers.

Within the stack, a bundler is commonly used to optimize and compile the final code.
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is currently one of the most prominent among them. It offers several
optimization options, but we're going to focus on one of them, [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/).

Tree shaking is responsible for dead code elimination. Nevertheless, to preserve
this functionality, [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) must be
configured correctly.

First of all, let's understand what the problem is.

A very simple example with <abbr title="ECMAScript modules">ESM</abbr>:

```js
// module.js
export const say = () => console.log('Say something')

export const scream = () => console.log('SCREAM SOMETHING')
```

```js
// App entrypoint
// index.js
import { scream } from './module.js'

scream()
```

In the `index.js` we only import the `scream` function from `module.js`.
Since the application doesn't use the `say` function, including it in the bundle
is unnecessary, and that's tree shaking purpose, dead code elimination.
However, to leverage modern features (as in the example, ESM modules
and arrow functions), while maintaining browser compatibility, Babeljs compiles
this code to an earlier JavaScript version.

Usually this is the basic configuration of Babeljs:

```json
{
  "presets": ["env"]
}
```

The only change needed is to set `modules` to `false`.

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "env",
      {
        "modules": false
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Basically, Babeljs compiles the code before webpack and converts the ES modules to
CommonJS by default, then, when it reaches webpack, it can't take advantage
of the native JavaScript modules.

This is a simple example, but when the application gets bigger and makes use of a
lot of libraries, it doesn't make sense to overload it with unused code.

## Loose Mode

Another tip: many of the Babeljs presets have a parameter called `loose`, and
[babel-preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env.html) is one of them.
Essentially, Babeljs compiles code containing features unsupported in `ES5`,
transforming them into an ES5-compatible version while preserving the original
functionality and semantics. In `loose mode` Babeljs compiles to `ES5`,
prioritizing reduced code size, often resulting in significantly smaller output.
As our bundle will be interpreted directly in the browser or nodejs, strict semantic
adherence is less critical, and we still maintain the source file.

To enable:

```jsonc
// babel.config.js
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "env",
      {
        "modules": false,
        "loose": true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Read [Babel: Loose mode](https://medium.com/reactbrasil/babel-loose-mode-b4c2092a84be)
for some examples with code generated using `loose mode`.

> PS. I recommend to be careful with `loose mode`, normally it's not recommended,
